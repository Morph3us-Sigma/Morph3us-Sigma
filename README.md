### Headings
To create a heading, add 1 to 6 # symbols before your heading text. The number of # you use will determine the hierarchy level and typeface size of the heading.
# A first-level heading
## A second-level heading
### A third-level heading
etc...
When you use two or more headings, GitHub automatically generates a table of contents that you can access by clicking  within the file header.
Each heading title is listed in the table of contents and you can click a title to navigate to the selected section.

### Styling text
You can indicate emphasis with bold, italic, strikethrough, subscript, or superscript text in comment fields and .md files.

Bold	** ** or __ __	Ctrl+B (Windows/Linux)	**This is bold text**
Italic	* * or _ _ â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒ	Ctrl+I (Windows/Linux)	_This text is italicized_
Strikethrough	~~ ~~	None	~~This was mistaken text~~
Bold and nested italic	** ** and _ _	None	**This text is _extremely_ important**
All bold and italic	*** ***	None	***All this text is important***
Subscript	<sub> </sub>	None	This is a <sub>subscript</sub> text
Superscript	<sup> </sup>	None	This is a <sup>superscript</sup> text
Underline	<ins> </ins>	None	This is an <ins>underlined</ins> text

### Quoting text
You can quote text with a >.
Text that is not a quote
> Text that is a quote
Quoted text is indented, with a different type color.
When viewing a conversation, you can automatically quote text in a comment by highlighting the text, then typing R. You can quote an entire comment by clicking Â·Â·Â·, then Quote reply.
